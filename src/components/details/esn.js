            <h3>My Role:</h3>
            <p>The ESN works in the interest of international students. To improve their social and practical integration as well as their rights and needs. The ESN also actively tries to expand the knowledge and views of international student by pushing for and facililating exchange and transfer programmes.</p>

            <p>Being the ESN Hertfordshire Webmaster, I made regular updates to the ESN Hertfordshire website and buddy system to enable an optimal user experience.</p>

            <p>The buddy system being a means of aiding and assistint exchange students which drew me into the ESN as it is a volunteer organisation and as such I was motivated to create an algorithm to make the pairing system more accurate and easier by narrowing down potential perfect matches based on information stored in a PHP database from a form I created for them to fill. </p>
